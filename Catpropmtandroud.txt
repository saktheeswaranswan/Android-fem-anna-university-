cst prompt


Got it. I’ll rewrite the full p5.js sketch to simulate a plane stress problem assuming a CST (Constant Strain Triangle) model and brittle material behavior. The mesh will still be controlled by a slider, and when an element is selected, it will:
Display the Mohr’s Circle based on CST-assumed stress state.
Indicate failure if the max principal stress exceeds a certain brittle strength threshold.
Show the maximum normal stress on the element and flag if it violates brittle failure criteria.
I’ll let you know once the updated p5.js code is ready.
